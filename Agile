As a traveler, I want to compare Airbnb prices across neighborhoods so that I can plan my stay within budget.

As a host, I want to understand what factors influence higher booking rates so that I can optimize my listing.

As a data analyst, I want to predict the price of a listing based on location and features so that I can identify over/underpriced listings.
